escalation to that of a root user, and enter the content of the imroot.txt
file as the answer.
10. During as assignment, an incident responder has retained a suspicious executable
file “die-another-da” Your task as a malware analyst is to find the executable’s
Entry point (Address). The file is in the C:\Users\Admin\Documents directory in
the “EH Workstation – 2” machines.
11. You are investigating a massive DDoS attack launched against a target
at 10.10.1.10. Identify the attacking IP address that sent most packets to
the victim machine. The network capture file “attack-traffic.pcapng” is
saved in the Documents folder of the “EH Workstation – 1”
(ParrotSecurity) machine.
12. Perform the SQL injection attack on your target web application

training.cehorg.com, available at 192.168.0.64. Locate the Flag.txt file
and enter its content as the answer.
15. Perform SQL injection attack on a web application
cybersec.cehorg.com, available at 172.20.0.22. Find the value in the Flag
column in one of the DB tables and enter it as the answer.
16. A file named Hast.txt has been uploaded through DVWA
(http://172.20.0.16:8080/DVWA). The file is located in the
“C:\wamp64\www\DVWA\hackable\uploads\” directory. Access the file
